        <strong>I recomend you to go to Hawaii because of it's <em>weather.</em>It is a very nice trip and a lot of people have fun on it so I really hope if you can you should visit Hawaii it is a place I really want to go.</strong>
        <h4>On thing I like to do is sometimes when your traveling to a place. That you have never been too you should bring a notebook and write things on the trip that you learned. a You can also take pictures and make a small research report on the place that you went to, but you don't have to do it it is just a bouns thing. I like to do even Don't always write about the trip.  </h4>
